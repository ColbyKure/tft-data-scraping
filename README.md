# tft-data-scraping

Repo for practicing with the League of Legends API. 
GOAL -- Build a website for showing your match history and ranked history for current and past sets. 
WHY -- No other applications can graph further than 20 games. (this is the default setting)
WHEN -- Target finish this project in 3 months. 

==== PLANNING ====
1. Create a practice/reference script to show how to correctly query api
2. Create a standalone script callable from terminal to graph results in matplot or similar
3. Refactor python code into javascript for future use in webapp. (dont want to pay for backend services)
4. Mock frontend design for match history and LP graph over time (Use React)
5. Finalize the router endpoints to lockin the number of pages in webapp (for now)
6. Compile code and frontend into a full scale application
7. Deploy using vercel. Obtain website domain for the site.
